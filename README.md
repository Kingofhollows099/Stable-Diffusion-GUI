This is a personal project I made simply to add a UI to the Stable Diffusion XL model for ease of use.

For Setup:
    You must have Python installed on your computer.
    Simply run the batch (.bat) file included to download and install the neccesary libraries.

Use:
    Run the python (.py) file to open the menu.
    You can select a referance image that the AI will use to help make the picture be clicked "Add referance image". There is no limit on how many you can add.
    You can type your prompt in the labeled text entry bar.
    Once ready, click "Generate Image"
